# OOP-Canvas-Random-Shapes
Object-Oriented Programming Canvas with Random Shapes

This project implements a canvas in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) context, featuring random shape generation. The canvas contains rectangles, squares, circles, and ovals, each with unique dimensions. The shapes are generated with valid dimensions, and the canvas class ensures that duplicates are avoided.

Features:
- OOP implementation with inheritance and composition
- Random generation of rectangles, squares, circles, and ovals
- Canvas class managing a collection of unique shapes
